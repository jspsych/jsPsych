You can use the plugins that are included with jsPsych, use plugins that are developed by community members in the contrib repository, or create your own plugins. By assembling different plugins together into a timeline, it is possible to create a wide range of experiments.</p> <p>The page on timelines is a good place to start learning about jsPsych.

Most importantly, a <code>package.json</code> file lists other packages that the package depends on. The jsPsych and jspsych-contrib repositories use NPM workspaces. That means, running <code>npm install</code> in the repository root will install the dependencies for all packages in the <code>packages</code> directory. The core jsPsych library and every jsPsych plugin or extension is laid out as an individual package. These packages are published to the NPM registry where they can be downloaded by NPM or any CDN (such as unpkg).</p>"},{"location":"developers/configuration/#build-chain-and-build-artifacts","title":"Build chain and build artifacts","text":"<p>JsPsych comes with a build chain (specified in the <code>@jspsych/config</code> package) that can be executed by running <code>npm run build</code> in a package's directory. The build chain will read the package (starting at its <code>src/index.ts</code> file) and create the following build artifacts in the package's <code>dist</code> directory:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>index.js</code>    This file contains everything from <code>index.ts</code>, but as plain JavaScript and bundled in a single file (i.e. without <code>import</code>ing files from the same package).   It is used by bundlers like webpack.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>index.cjs</code>   Like <code>index.js</code>, but using the old CommonJS standard to support backwards-compatible tools like the Jest testing framework.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>index.browser.js</code>   This file, like <code>index.js</code>, contains the entire package as plain JavaScript, but this time wrapped in a function so that it can be included directly by browsers using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.   For plugins or extensions, the default export of a module (i.e. whatever statement comes after <code>export default</code> in the <code>index.ts</code> file) is assigned to a global variable.   The name of this global variable is specified in the package's <code>rollup.config.mjs</code> file, as a parameter to the <code>makeRollupConfig()</code> function.   Hence, for instance, including the <code>index.browser.js</code> file from the <code>plugin-html-keyboard-response</code> package would assign the <code>HtmlKeyboardResponsePlugin</code> class to the global <code>jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse</code> variable.   Because the code in <code>index.browser.js</code> looks very similar to the <code>index.ts</code> code but is fully supported by modern web browsers, all examples in the <code>examples</code> directory reference the <code>index.browser.js</code> files so users can also modify the source code directly without running the build chain.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>index.browser.min.js</code>   There are different versions of the JavaScript language specification and not all web browsers and browser versions support all JavaScript features.   That's why the jsPsych build chain uses Babel to translate the source files into code that a majority of web browsers can understand.   The result of this operation is <code>index.browser.min.js</code>.   It behaves just like <code>index.browser.js</code>, but adds support for older browsers by substituting new JavaScript features using older ones.   Because this is the recommended build artifact for production usage (and is automatically served by unpkg), the code in <code>index.browser.min.js</code> is also processed by Terser to reduce its size and speed up experiment loading times.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>*.js.map</code>   When debugging code in a browser (especially <code>index.browser.min.js</code>, which is not easily readable due to Terser and Babel), it is important to be able to read the original source code in the debugger.   For every build artifact, there is a <code>.map</code> file which contains a mapping of the generated code to the original source code.   Browsers automatically read these <code>.map</code> files and display the original code in their debuggers instead of the generated one.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>*.d.ts</code>   The <code>.d.ts</code> files contain the TypeScript type definitions that would otherwise be lost during compilation to plain JavaScript.   They are read by Typescript and editors when a package is imported into another TypeScript project.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"developers/configuration/#testing","title":"Testing","text":"<p>Automated code testing for jsPsych is implemented with Jest. </p> <p>To run the tests, install Node and npm.

This can make it easier to make changes and prevent errors, since the things that are common across questions only need to be defined once. Similarly, if you are repeating a trial procedure lots of times, then you might want to define a single <code>survey</code> trial that repeats with slightly different parameters. </p> <p>The following section presents some different options for programmatically defining multiple questions in a survey trial, or multiple survey trials, based on an array of values that should change across questions or trials.</p> <p>The example below shows how to use the <code>survey_function</code> to loop over a set of question-level variables (titles/prompts and names), and dynamically add each question to a single survey page.

But in cases where you have different question prompts that all use the same multiple choice options, you might prefer to use the the SurveyJS \"matrix\" question type. This question type creates a table where each row is a question and each column is a response option. The table format is often used for Likert scales, satisfaction surveys, etc. You can even create a table that repeats a set of questions with different response types using the SurveyJS multi-select matrix (\"matrixdropdown\") question type.</p> <p>Rather than repeating a question format within the same trial, perhaps you want to use trial-level variables to generate separate <code>survey</code> trials, for instance in order to incorporate them into a larger repeating trial procedure. jsPsych's timeline variables feature was designed to address this use case, but the use of timeline variables looks a little different with the <code>survey</code> plugin. This is because the various individual parameters that you might want to change across <code>survey</code> trials don't have their own plugin parameters - instead everything is nested within the <code>survey_json</code> parameter. Below are some examples showing how you can programmatically generate survey trials using a set of trial-level variables.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use the conventional timeline variables approach with the <code>survey_json</code> parameter. This approach is probably not ideal, because the timeline variables array has to contain the entire <code>survey_json</code> object for each trial. This kind of defeats the purpose of timeline variables, because you are still defining all of the survey JSON separately for each question/trial. In any case, here's what it looks like:</p> <pre><code>const word_trials = {\n  timeline: [\n    {\n      type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,\n      stimulus: '+',\n      choices: \"NO_KEYS\",\n      trial_duration: 500\n    },\n    {\n      type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,\n      stimulus: jsPsych.timelineVariable('word'),\n      choices: \"NO_KEYS\",\n      trial_duration: 1000\n    },\n    {\n      type: jsPsychSurvey,\n      survey_json: jsPsych.timelineVariable('survey_json'),\n      data: { word: jsPsych.timelineVariable('word') }\n    }\n  ],\n  timeline_variables: [\n    {\n      word: 'cheese',\n      survey_json: { elements: [ {type: \"text\", title: \"Enter a word related to CHEESE:\", autocomplete: \"off\" } ], showQuestionNumbers: false, completeText: \"Next\", focusFirstQuestionAutomatic: true } \n    },\n    {\n      word: 'ring',\n      survey_json: { elements: [ {type: \"text\", title: \"Enter a word related to RING:\", autocomplete: \"off\" } ], showQuestionNumbers: false, completeText: \"Next\", focusFirstQuestionAutomatic: true } \n    },\n    {\n      word: 'bat',\n      survey_json: { elements: [ {type: \"text\", title: \"Enter a word related to BAT:\", autocomplete: \"off\" } ], showQuestionNumbers: false, completeText: \"Next\", focusFirstQuestionAutomatic: true }\n    },\n    {\n      word: 'cow',\n      survey_json: { elements: [ {type: \"text\", title: \"Enter a word related to COW:\", autocomplete: \"off\" } ], showQuestionNumbers: false, completeText: \"Next\", focusFirstQuestionAutomatic: true }\n    }\n  ]\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Consider using a survey-* plugin for presenting a single question type</p> <p>The example above was created just to demonstrate how to combine the <code>survey</code> plugin and timeline variables. But if this were a real experiment, since each survey trial contains just one question, we'd be better off using one of the other survey-* plugins because the parameterization of those plugins works well with timeline variables. Of course, you may have other reasons for wanting to use the <code>survey</code> plugin in this type of trial procedure, for instance to take advantage of some its convenience features (e.g. different question types on the same page, response validation).</p> </li> <li> <p>Use jsPsych's functions-as-parameters approach for the <code>survey_json</code> parameter. With this approach, instead of defining a static JSON object for the value of <code>survey_json</code>, you would write a function that returns the survey JSON object for that specific trial. </p> <p>This approach allows you to define the survey content using a combination of variable and static values. Also, jsPsych will run this function right before the trial begins, which means that you can change the survey content dynamically based on information that only becomes available during the experiment. Here's an example using timeline variables, though you can use the same approach to dynamically create the survey content without using timeline variables.</p> <pre><code>const word_trials = {\n  timeline: [\n    {\n      type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,\n      stimulus: '+',\n      choices: \"NO_KEYS\",\n      trial_duration: 500\n    },\n    {\n      type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,\n      stimulus: jsPsych.timelineVariable('word'),\n      choices: \"NO_KEYS\",\n      trial_duration: 1000\n    },\n    {\n      type: jsPsychSurvey,\n      survey_json: function() {\n        // This is a function that dynamically creates the JSON configuration for each trial.\n        // Inside the function, you can access timeline variables, jsPsych data, and other global variables\n        // that you define. This function will be called right before the trial starts.\n        const this_trial_json = { \n          elements: [\n            {\n              type: \"text\", \n              title: `Enter a word related to ${jsPsych.timelineVariable('word').toUpperCase()}:`, \n              autocomplete: \"off\" \n            }\n          ], \n          showQuestionNumbers: false, \n          completeText: \"Next\", \n          focusFirstQuestionAutomatic: true \n        }\n        return this_trial_json;\n      },\n      data: { word: jsPsych.timelineVariable('word') }\n    }\n  ],\n  timeline_variables: [\n    { word: 'cheese' },\n    { word: 'ring' },\n    { word: 'bat' },\n    { word: 'cow' }\n  ]\n};\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Use the <code>survey_function</code> parameter. You can reference trial-level variables from inside this function, so the general idea here is the same as the example above. The difference is that here you are using SurveyJS's JavaScript API syntax to create the survey content, instead of the JSON configuration. Again, this could be done without timeline variables, but this example uses timeline variables for convenience:</p> <pre><code>const create_word_survey = (survey) =&gt; {\n  // Create question using timeline variables\n  const page = survey.addNewPage('page1');\n  const question = page.addNewQuestion('text'); \n  question.title = `Enter a word related to ${jsPsych.timelineVariable('word').toUpperCase()}`;\n  question.autocomplete = \"off\";\n  // Set survey-level parameters\n  survey.showQuestionNumbers = false;\n  survey.completeText = \"Next\";\n  survey.focusFirstQuestionAutomatic = true;\n}\n\nconst word_trials = {\n  timeline: [\n    {\n      type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,\n      stimulus: '+',\n      choices: \"NO_KEYS\",\n      trial_duration: 500\n    },\n    {\n      type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,\n      stimulus: jsPsych.timelineVariable('word'),\n      choices: \"NO_KEYS\",\n      trial_duration: 1000\n    },\n    {\n      type: jsPsychSurvey,\n      survey_function: create_word_survey,\n      data: { word: jsPsych.timelineVariable('word') }\n    }\n  ],\n  timeline_variables: [\n    { word: 'cheese' },\n    { word: 'ring' },\n    { word: 'bat' },\n    { word: 'cow' }\n  ]\n};\n</code></pre> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"overview/data/","title":"Data Storage, Aggregation, and Manipulation","text":""},{"location":"overview/data/#data-in-jspsych-permanent-and-non-permanent-data","title":"Data in jsPsych: permanent and non-permanent data.","text":"<p>There are two very different kinds of data storage: data stored in memory and data stored permanently.

The calibration is not robust to head movements.</li> <li>WebGazer's click-based calibration can be used throughout the experiment. You can turn this on by calling <code>jsPsych.extensions.webgazer.startMouseCalibration()</code> at any point in the experiment. If you use a continue button to advance through the experiment and move the location of the continue button around you can be making small adjustments to the calibration throughout. </li> <li>Computing the gaze predictions consumes more computational resources than most other things that jsPsych is typically used for. The sampling rate that WebGazer is able to achieve will depend on the computing power of the participant's device. You may want to ask the participant to close any non-essential software and browser windows prior to completing the experiment.

Other plugins are more specific, like those that display particular kinds of stimuli (e.g., a circular visual search array), or run a specific version of particular kind of task (e.g., the Implicit Association Test). Part of creating an experiment with jsPsych involves figuring out which plugins are needed to create the tasks you want your participants to perform.</p> <p>Plugins provide a structure for a particular trial or task, but often allow for significant customization and flexibility. For example, the image-keyboard-response plugin defines a simple structure for showing an image and collecting a keyboard response. You can specify the what the stimulus is, what keys the participant is allowed to press, how long the stimulus should be on the screen, how long the participant has to respond, and so on. Many of these options have reasonable default values; even though the image plugin has many different parameters, you only need to specify the image stimulus in order to use it.

This isn't a problem when your study runs online, because in that case your experiment files all have the same origin. However, when you run your experiment offline, the CORS policy blocks some jsPsych features that require loading local files. If your experiment uses these features, then CORS errors will prevent the experiment from running. </p> <p>To prevent these errors, jsPsych uses a 'safe mode' when it detects that the HTML page is running via the <code>file://</code> protocol, and if so, automatically disables the features that don't work in that context. Specifically, when a jsPsych experiment runs offline:</p> <ul> <li>Web Audio is disabled (even if <code>use_webaudio</code> is set to <code>true</code> in <code>initJsPsych</code>). The WebAudio API option is used by default because it allows more precise measurement of response times relative to the onset of the audio. But because WebAudio doesn't work offline, audio will be played using HTML5 audio instead. This is equivalent to setting  <code>use_webaudio</code>  to <code>false</code> in <code>initJsPsych</code>.</li> <li>Video preloading is disabled (both automatic and manual preloading via the <code>preload</code> plugin). Videos will still play when you run your experiment offline, but they will load during the experiment, which might cause noticeable delays before video playback starts.</li> </ul> <p>This safe mode feature is controlled by the <code>override_safe_mode</code> parameter in <code>initJsPsych</code>, which defaults to <code>false</code>. If you leave this setting as the default, then you won't need to worry about CORS errors while running your experiment offline, or remembering to change your <code>initJsPsych</code> settings when you move the experiment online.</p> <p>It's possible to override jsPsych's safe mode by setting <code>override_safe_mode</code> to <code>true</code> in <code>initJsPsych</code>. One reason you might do this is if you've disabled web security features in your browser (see here and here for instructions in Chrome), which is safe to do if you know what you're doing. If your experiment does not use Web Audio or preloaded videos, then jsPsych's safe mode feature will not have any effect. </p> <p>The <code>override_safe_mode</code> parameter also has no effect when your experiment is running online a web server, because the page will be loaded via the <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> protocol.</p>"},{"location":"overview/running-experiments/#media-loading","title":"Media loading","text":"<p>While running your experiment offline, any media files are likely to load very quickly because they are stored on your own computer's disk.

However, when your experiment is hosted on a remote server, the files will need to be transferred over the internet, which means they will take longer to load - in some cases much longer. Loading delays are most noticeable with media files: images, audio, and video. As explained on the Media Preloading page, loading delays during your experiment can cause problems for stimulus display and response times. </p> <p>It is important to test your experiment to ensure that any media files are preloading successfully and not being requested again during the experiment. You can use the Network tab in your browser's developer tools to see when files are loaded and to simulate a slow internet connection (see here for Chrome Network tab documentation). If you are preloading many and/or large files, such as videos, you may want to increase the <code>max_load_time</code> parameter in <code>the preload plugin</code> so that participants with slow/unreliable internet connections will be able to take part in your experiment.</p>"},{"location":"overview/running-experiments/#permanent-data-storage","title":"Permanent data storage","text":"<p>As explained in the Data Storage, Aggregation, and Manipulation page, jsPsych stores information in the participant's browser.

Some common examples of this in cognitive behavioral research are version counterbalancing, where the experiment code needs to access and update the history of version assignment in order to determine which version should be assigned, and multi-session/training studies, where the experiment might need to access and update information about each participant like their current session number, task difficulty level, etc. </p> <p>Doing these things in an automated way requires the use of a server.

In these cases, you might find it useful to create CSS rules rather than using inline CSS. </p> <p>Creating CSS rules is a lot like using inline CSS, except that you also need to use a CSS selector. This is because your CSS rules aren't attached to any specific HTML element (unlike inline CSS), so you need to tell the browser which element(s) the style rules should apply to.

The specificity will depend on the CSS selectors that are used. In addition to using the tag name (e.g. \"p\"), other common CSS selectors include the element's ID or class. If you are selecting an element using it's ID, then the CSS selector needs to have a # in front of the ID, e.g. \"#stimulus\". If you are selecting elements based on their class, then you need to include a . in front of the class, e.g. \".large-text\".</p> <p>In the example below, the \"#stimulus\" CSS selector means that the width change will only affect elements with the \"stimulus\" ID, and the \".large-text\" CSS selector means that the font size change will only affect elements that have the \"large-text\" class.</p> <pre><code>#stimulus \n    width: 300px;\n}\n.large-text {\n    font-size: 200%;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>It is possible to create even more specific CSS selectors, for instance by combining tags, IDs, and/or classes.

In the 'fixation' example below, separating the style rules from the <code>stimulus</code> string makes the code a little bit 'cleaner', and this makes it easier to re-use the same style rules in other parts of the experiment.</p> <pre><code> &lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.3.4\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-html-keyboard-response@1.1.3\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.3.4/css/jspsych.css\"&gt;\n  &lt;style&gt; \n    .fixation {font-size: 90px; font-weight: bold; color: gray;}\n  &lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\nvar fixation = {\n    type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,\n    stimulus: '+',\n    choices: \"NO_KEYS\",\n    trial_duration: 500,\n    css_classes: ['fixation']\n}\n// ...\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>You may want the  <code>css_classes</code> parameter to vary across trials. If so, you can turn it into a dynamic parameter or use timeline variables (see examples below).</p> <p>One thing to note about the <code>css_classes</code> parameter is that it only adds the class(es) to the jspsych-content &lt;div&gt; element, which is the \"parent\" element that contains all of the experiment content. Often you'll want your CSS rules to be applied to other elements inside of this jspsych-content div. Sometimes your CSS rules will be \"inherited\" by all of the other jsPsych content inside of this parent &lt;div&gt;. For instance, in the <code>fixation</code> example above, the CSS rules that change the font size, weight and color are applied to the parent &lt;div&gt; and automatically passed on to the stimulus text through inheritance.</p> <p>There are two reasons why a CSS rule like the one above for <code>fixation</code> may not work the way you expect:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Not all CSS properties are inherited from the parent element.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a CSS property is inherited from the parent element, it will affect all elements in a given trial. </p> </li> </ol> <p>In these cases, you can change your CSS selector to make it more specific: add a space after class name, then add more CSS selectors to select the specific element(s) that you want to change. </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>To find out this more specific CSS selector, you can right-click on the element and select Inspect. In the inspector window, right-click on the property corresponding to the element and copy the selector. You might need to increase the trial's <code>trial_duration</code> to give yourself enough time to inspect the elements on the page.

Once you have selected an element on the page, you can see all of the information that can be used to select it, including:</p> <ol> <li>tag name, e.g., \"div\", \"p\", \"img\", \"button\"</li> <li>ID, if it has one</li> <li>class(es), if it has any</li> </ol> <p>You can then use this information to create a CSS selector to modify that element's style.</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, jsPsych adds its own IDs and classes to many elements. You can use the developer tools to determine what IDs and classes already exist for the elements that you want to modify, as you may can often just use these instead of adding your own. For instance, in the \"html-keyboard-response\" plugin, the stimulus will always be shown in a &lt;div&gt; with the ID \"jspsych-html-keyboard-response-stimulus\". So you can create a CSS rule that is applied to all \"html-keyboard-response\" stimuli like this:</p> <pre><code>#jspsych-html-keyboard-response-stimulus {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: blue;\n  width: 100px;\n  border: 4px solid black;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As another example, most jsPsych buttons have the class \"jspsych-btn\", so you can use this class to change the default button styling:</p> <pre><code>.jspsych-btn {\n  padding: 20px 20px;\n  font-size: 25px;\n  border-color: black;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can also use the developer tools to change an element's CSS and immediately see the effect that the changes will have on the page. These changes are just temporary, so you will still need to use one of methods described above to add the CSS changes to your experiment. However, making changes in the developer tools is very useful for figuring out which CSS properties to change and which values to use. This area of the developer tools also shows what styles are currently applied to the element and where those style rules are coming from. </p> <p></p> <p>There are a few things to be aware of while debugging problems with CSS. </p> <ol> <li>When there are conflicting CSS rules, some CSS rules will take precedence over others. For instance, inline CSS usually takes precedence over other CSS rules, and more specific CSS selectors usually take precedence over less specific ones. </li> <li>When there are conflicting CSS rules that have the same level of precedence, the last rule will override any earlier rules. For that reason it's important to add your own custom stylesheet after the default jspsych.css stylesheet. See this page about CSS precedence for more information.</li> </ol> <p>If one CSS style rule is overridden by another one, the rule that is overridden will appear in strikethrough text in the element's \"Styles\" section.

See version history.</p> <p>SurveyJS version: 1.9.138</p> <p>This plugin is a wrapper for the SurveyJS form library. It displays survey-style questions across one or more pages. You can mix different question types on the same page, and participants can navigate back and forth through multiple survey pages without losing responses. SurveyJS provides a large number of built-in question types, response validation options, conditional display options, special response options (\"None\", \"Select all\", \"Other\"), and other useful features for building complex surveys. See the Building Surveys in jsPsych page for a more detailed list of all options and features.</p> <p>With SurveyJS, surveys can be defined using a JavaScript/JSON object, a JavaScript function, or a combination of both. The jsPsych <code>survey</code> plugin provides parameters that accept these methods of constructing a SurveyJS survey, and passes them into SurveyJS. The fact that this plugin just acts as a wrapper means you can take advantage of all of the SurveyJS features, and copy/paste directly from SurveyJS examples into the plugin's <code>survey_json</code> parameter (for JSON object configuration) or <code>survey_function</code> parameter (for JavaScript code).</p> <p>This page contains the plugin's reference information and examples. The Building Surveys in jsPsych page contains a more detailed guide for using this plugin.</p> <p>For the most comprehensive guides on survey configuration and features, please see the SurveyJS form library documentation and examples.</p> <p>Limitations</p> <p>The jsPsych <code>survey</code> plugin is not compatible with certain jsPsych and SurveyJS features. Specifically:</p> <ul> <li>It is not always well-suited for use with jsPsych's timeline variables feature. This is because the timeline variables array must store the entire <code>survey_json</code> object for each trial, rather than just the parameters that change across trials, which are nested within the <code>survey_json</code> object. We offer some alternative methods for dynamically constructing questions/trials in this section of the Building Surveys in jsPsych documentation page.</li> <li>It does not support the SurveyJS \"complete page\" parameter. This is a parameter for HTML formatted content that should appear after the participant clicks the 'submit' button. Instead of using this parameter, you should create another jsPsych trial that comes after the survey trial to serve the same purpose.</li> <li>It does not support the SurveyJS question's <code>correctAnswer</code> property, which is used for SurveyJS quizzes and automatic response scoring. SurveyJS does not store this value or the response score in the data - instead this is only used to display scores on the survey's 'complete page'. Since the complete page is not supported, this 'correctAnswer' property also does not work as intended in the jsPsych plugin.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"plugins/survey/#parameters","title":"Parameters","text":"<p>In addition to the parameters available in all plugins, this plugin accepts the following parameters.

The trial can be ended automatically when the participant responds, when the video file has finished playing, or if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time. You can also prevent a button response from being made before the video has finished playing. The button itself can be customized using HTML formatting.</p> <p>Video files can be automatically preloaded by jsPsych using the <code>preload</code> plugin. However, if you are using timeline variables or another dynamic method to specify the video stimulus, you will need to manually preload the videos. Also note that video preloading is disabled when the experiment is running as a file (i.e. opened directly in the browser, rather than through a server), in order to prevent CORS errors - see the section on Running Experiments for more information.</p>"},{"location":"plugins/video-button-response/#parameters","title":"Parameters","text":"<p>In addition to the parameters available in all plugins, this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of undefined must be specified. Other parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.</p> Parameter Type Default Value Description stimulus array undefined An array of file paths to the video. You can specify multiple formats of the same video (e.g., .mp4, .ogg, .webm) to maximize the cross-browser compatibility. Usually .mp4 is a safe cross-browser option. The plugin does not reliably support .mov files. The player will use the first source file in the array that is compatible with the browser, so specify the files in order of preference. choices array of strings undefined Labels for the buttons. Each different string in the array will generate a different button. button_html HTML string <code>'&lt;button class=\"jspsych-btn\"&gt;%choice%&lt;/button&gt;'</code> A template of HTML for generating the button elements. You can override this to create customized buttons of various kinds. The string <code>%choice%</code> will be changed to the corresponding element of the <code>choices</code> array. You may also specify an array of strings, if you need different HTML to render for each button. If you do specify an array, the <code>choices</code> array and this array must have the same length. The HTML from position 0 in the <code>button_html</code> array will be used to create the button for element 0 in the <code>choices</code> array, and so on. margin_vertical string '0px' Vertical margin of the button(s). margin_horizontal string '8px' Horizontal margin of the button(s). prompt string null This string can contain HTML markup. Any content here will be displayed below the stimulus. The intention is that it can be used to provide a reminder about the action the participant is supposed to take (e.g., which key to press). width numeric width of the video file The width of the video display in pixels. height numeric heigh of the video file The height of the video display in pixels. autoplay boolean true If true, the video will begin playing as soon as it has loaded. controls boolean false If true, controls for the video player will be available to the participant. They will be able to pause the video or move the playback to any point in the video. start numeric null If given a value, the video will start at this time point in seconds. stop numeric null If given a value, the video will stop at this time point in seconds. rate numeric null The playback rate of the video. 1 is normal, &lt;1 is slower, &gt;1 is faster. trial_ends_after_video bool false If true, then the trial will end as soon as the video file finishes playing. trial_duration numeric null How long to wait for the participant to make a response before ending the trial in milliseconds. If the participant fails to make a response before this timer is reached, the participant's response will be recorded as null for the trial and the trial will end. If the value of this parameter is null, then the trial will wait for a response indefinitely. response_ends_trial boolean true If true, then the trial will end whenever the participant makes a response (assuming they make their response before the cutoff specified by the <code>trial_duration</code> parameter).

To calculate the pixel-to-cm conversion rate for a participant\u2019s display, participants are asked to place a credit card or other item of the same size on the screen and resize an image until it is the same size as the credit card. Since we know the physical dimensions of the card, we can find the conversion rate for the participant's display.</p> <p>Phase 2. To measure the participant's viewing distance from their screen we use a blind spot task. Participants are asked to focus on a black square on the screen with their right eye closed, while a red dot repeatedly sweeps from right to left. They press the spacebar on their keyboard whenever they perceive that the red dot has disappeared. This part allows the plugin to use the distance between the black square and the red dot when it disappears from eyesight to estimate how far the participant is from the monitor.

See table below. <p>The settings object can contain several parameters. None of the parameters are required.</p> Parameter Type Description display_element string The ID of an HTML element to display the experiment in. If left blank, jsPsych will use the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element to display content. All keyboard event listeners are bound to this element. In order for a keyboard event to be detected, this element must have focus (be the last thing that the participant clicked on). on_finish function Function to execute when the experiment ends. on_trial_start function Function to execute when a new trial begins. on_trial_finish function Function to execute when a trial ends. on_data_update function Function to execute every time data is stored using the <code>jsPsych.data.write</code> method. All plugins use this method to save data (via a call to <code>jsPsych.finishTrial</code>, so this function runs every time a plugin stores new data. on_interaction_data_update function Function to execute every time a new interaction event occurs. Interaction events include clicking on a different window (blur), returning to the experiment window (focus), entering full screen mode (fullscreenenter), and exiting full screen mode (fullscreenexit). on_close function Function to execute when the user leaves the page. Can be used, for example, to save data before the page is closed. exclusions object Specifies restrictions on the browser the participant can use to complete the experiment. See list of options below. This feature is deprecated as of v7.1 and will be removed in v8.0. The browser-check plugin is an improved way to handle exclusions. show_progress_bar boolean If <code>true</code>, then a progress bar is shown at the top of the page. Default is <code>false</code>. message_progress_bar string Message to display next to the progress bar. The default is 'Completion Progress'. auto_update_progress_bar boolean If true, then the progress bar at the top of the page will automatically update as every top-level timeline or trial is completed. use_webaudio boolean If false, then jsPsych will not attempt to use the WebAudio API for audio playback. Instead, HTML5 Audio objects will be used. The WebAudio API offers more precise control over the timing of audio events, and should be used when possible. The default value is <code>true</code>. default_iti numeric The default inter-trial interval in ms. The default value if none is specified is 0ms. experiment_width numeric The desired width of the jsPsych container in pixels. If left undefined, the width will be 100% of the display element. Usually this is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, and the width will be 100% of the screen size. minimum_valid_rt numeric The minimum valid response time for key presses during the experiment. Any key press response time that is less than this value will be treated as invalid and ignored. Note that this parameter only applies to keyboard responses, and not to other response types such as buttons and sliders. The default value is 0. override_safe_mode boolean Running a jsPsych experiment directly in a web browser (e.g., by double clicking on a local HTML file) will load the page using the <code>file://</code> protocol. Some features of jsPsych don't work with this protocol. By default, when jsPsych detects that it's running on a page loaded via the <code>file://</code> protocol, it runs in safe mode, which automatically disables features that don't work in this context. Specifically, the use of Web Audio is disabled (audio will be played using HTML5 audio instead, even if <code>use_webaudio</code> is <code>true</code>) and video preloading is disabled. The <code>override_safe_mode</code> parameter defaults to <code>false</code>, but you can set it to <code>true</code> to force these features to operate under the <code>file://</code> protocol. In order for this to work, you will need to disable web security (CORS) features in your browser - this is safe to do if you know what you are doing. Note that this parameter has no effect when you are running the experiment on a web server, because the page will be loaded via the <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> protocol. case_sensitive_responses boolean If <code>true</code>, then jsPsych will make a distinction between uppercase and lowercase keys when evaluating keyboard responses, e.g. \"A\" (uppercase) will not be recognized as a valid response if the trial only accepts \"a\" (lowercase). If false, then jsPsych will not make a distinction between uppercase and lowercase keyboard responses, e.g. both \"a\" and \"A\" responses will be valid when the trial's key choice parameter is \"a\". Setting this parameter to false is useful if you want key responses to be treated the same way when CapsLock is turned on or the Shift key is held down. The default value is <code>false</code>. extensions array Array containing information about one or more jsPsych extensions that are used during the experiment. Each extension should be specified as an object with <code>type</code> (required), which is the name of the extension, and <code>params</code> (optional), which is an object containing any parameter-value pairs to be passed to the extension's <code>initialize</code> function. Default value is an empty array. <p>Possible values for the exclusions parameter above.</p> Parameter Type Description min_width numeric The minimum width of the browser window. If the width is below this value, a message will be displayed to the participant asking them to maximize their browser window. The experiment will sit on this page until the browser window is large enough. min_height numeric Same as above, but with height. audio boolean Set to true to require support for the WebAudio API (used by plugins that play audio files)."},{"location":"reference/jspsych/#return-value","title":"Return value","text":"<p>Returns a jsPsych instance, which all jsPsych methods on this page are called on.

We can change that by using a different value for the <code>trial_duration</code> parameter in the <code>fixation</code> trial for each trial. But how can we do that and keep the simple code structure we have now where we only have to define the fixation trial once? One option would be to add another timeline variable, like <code>\"fixation_duration\"</code> and use that to control the timing. But another option is to specify the <code>trial_duration</code> parameter as a function. If a parameter is a function, jsPsych will execute the function every time the trial runs.

Using the <code>jsPsych.pluginAPI.commpareKeys</code> function here means that the response will be scored correctly, even if the participant holds down Shift or has Caps Lock on. </p> <p>This function is only relevant for keyboard responses; for other kinds of responses, such as button presses, you can simply compare the response and correct response values directly, e.g. <pre><code>data.correct = data.response === data.correct_response;\n</code></pre></p> The complete code so far <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;My experiment&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.3.4\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-html-keyboard-response@1.1.3\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-image-keyboard-response@1.1.3\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-preload@1.1.3\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.3.4/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n  &lt;script&gt;\n\n    /* initialize jsPsych */\n    var jsPsych = initJsPsych({\n      on_finish: function() {\n        jsPsych.data.displayData();\n      }\n    });\n\n    /* create timeline */\n    var timeline = [];\n\n    /* preload images */\n    var preload = {\n      type: jsPsychPreload,\n      images: ['img/blue.png', 'img/orange.png']\n    };\n    timeline.push(preload);\n\n    /* define welcome message trial */\n    var welcome = {\n      type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,\n      stimulus: \"Welcome to the experiment.
