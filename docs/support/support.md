# Support

For questions about jsPsych, the preferred method of support is [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/discussions). Questions are most likely to be answered when they include a reproducible example of the problem. If you can make your code available online and link to the experiment, that will make the question easier to answer. Please consider searching through the archive of Q&As before posting a new question.

If you have identified a problem with jsPsych, such as a bug in the code or an error in the documentation, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/issues/new) on GitHub. 

If you have a suggestion for fixing the problem, feel free to [contribute to the project](../developers/contributing.md)!

We also manage a Discord for jsPsych users and developers to get peer support for coding projects, in addition to feedback from our core maintenance team. We host virtual hackathons on the server as well! Feel free to join at our [#welcome-and-rules channel](https://discord.gg/YveQdPMbYz), where you'll get a breakdown of the server and how to find what you need.

Inquiries for paid consultation to develop experiments using jsPsych or to create new custom jsPsych features can be sent to [josh.deleeuw@gmail.com](mailto:josh.deleeuw@gmail.com).
