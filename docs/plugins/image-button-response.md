# image-button-response

Current version: 1.2.0. [See version history](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/blob/main/packages/plugin-image-button-response/CHANGELOG.md).

This plugin displays an image and records responses generated with a button click. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time. The button itself can be customized using HTML formatting.

Image files can be automatically preloaded by jsPsych using the [`preload` plugin](preload.md). However, if you are using timeline variables or another dynamic method to specify the image stimulus, you will need to [manually preload](../overview/media-preloading.md#manual-preloading) the images.

## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](../overview/plugins.md#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Other parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
----------|------|---------------|------------
stimulus | string | undefined | The path of the image file to be displayed.
stimulus_height | integer | null | Set the height of the image in pixels. If left null (no value specified), then the image will display at its natural height.
stimulus_width | integer | null | Set the width of the image in pixels. If left null (no value specified), then the image will display at its natural width.
maintain_aspect_ratio | boolean | true | If setting *only* the width or *only* the height and this parameter is true, then the other dimension will be scaled to maintain the image's aspect ratio. 
choices | array of strings | [] | Labels for the buttons. Each different string in the array will generate a different button.
button_html | function | ``(choice: string, choice_index: number)=>`<button class="jspsych-btn">${choice}</button>``; | A function that generates the HTML for each button in the `choices` array. The function gets the string and index of the item in the `choices` array and should return valid HTML. If you want to use different markup for each button, you can do that by using a conditional on either parameter. The default parameter returns a button element with the text label of the choice.
prompt | string | null | This string can contain HTML markup. Any content here will be displayed below the stimulus. The intention is that it can be used to provide a reminder about the action the participant is supposed to take (e.g., which key to press).
stimulus_duration | numeric | null | How long to show the stimulus for in milliseconds. If the value is null, then the stimulus will be shown until the participant makes a response.
trial_duration | numeric | null | How long to wait for the participant to make a response before ending the trial in milliseconds. If the participant fails to make a response before this timer is reached, the participant's response will be recorded as null for the trial and the trial will end. If the value of this parameter is null, the trial will wait for a response indefinitely.
button_layout | string | 'grid' | Setting to `'grid'` will make the container element have the CSS property `display: grid` and enable the use of `grid_rows` and `grid_columns`. Setting to `'flex'` will make the container element have the CSS property `display: flex`. You can customize how the buttons are laid out by adding inline CSS in the `button_html` parameter.
grid_rows | number | 1 | The number of rows in the button grid. Only applicable when `button_layout` is set to `'grid'`. If null, the number of rows will be determined automatically based on the number of buttons and the number of columns.
grid_columns | number | null | The number of columns in the button grid. Only applicable when `button_layout` is set to `'grid'`. If null, the number of columns will be determined automatically based on the number of buttons and the number of rows.
response_ends_trial | boolean | true | If true, then the trial will end whenever the participant makes a response (assuming they make their response before the cutoff specified by the `trial_duration` parameter). If false, then the trial will continue until the value for `trial_duration` is reached. You can set this parameter to `false` to force the participant to view a stimulus for a fixed amount of time, even if they respond before the time is complete.
render_on_canvas | boolean | true | If true, the image will be drawn onto a canvas element. This prevents a blank screen (white flash) between consecutive image trials in some browsers, like Firefox and Edge. If false, the image will be shown via an img element, as in previous versions of jsPsych. If the stimulus is an **animated gif**, you must set this parameter to false, because the canvas rendering method will only present static images.
enable_button_after | numeric | 0 | How long the button will delay enabling in milliseconds.

## Data Generated

In addition to the [default data collected by all plugins](../overview/plugins.md#data-collected-by-all-plugins), this plugin collects the following data for each trial.

Name | Type | Value
-----|------|------
rt | numeric | The response time in milliseconds for the participant to make a response. The time is measured from when the stimulus first appears on the screen until the participant's response.
response | numeric | Indicates which button the participant pressed. The first button in the `choices` array is 0, the second is 1, and so on.
stimulus | string | The path of the image that was displayed.
