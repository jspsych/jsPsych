# html-button-response

Current version: 1.2.0. [See version history](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/blob/main/packages/plugin-html-button-response/CHANGELOG.md).

This plugin displays HTML content and records responses generated by button click. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time. The button itself can be customized using HTML formatting.

## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](../overview/plugins.md#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Other parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
----------|------|---------------|------------
stimulus | HTML string | undefined | The HTML content to be displayed.
choices | array of strings | [] | Labels for the buttons. Each different string in the array will generate a different button.
button_html | HTML string | `'<button class="jspsych-btn">%choice%</button>'` | A template of HTML for generating the button elements. You can override this to create customized buttons of various kinds. The string `%choice%` will be changed to the corresponding element of the `choices` array. You may also specify an array of strings, if you need different HTML to render for each button. If you do specify an array, the `choices` array and this array must have the same length. The HTML from position 0 in the `button_html` array will be used to create the button for element 0 in the `choices` array, and so on.
prompt | string | null | This string can contain HTML markup. Any content here will be displayed below the stimulus. The intention is that it can be used to provide a reminder about the action the participant is supposed to take (e.g., which key to press).
trial_duration | numeric | null | How long to wait for the participant to make a response before ending the trial in milliseconds. If the participant fails to make a response before this timer is reached, the participant's response will be recorded as null for the trial and the trial will end. If the value of this parameter is null, the trial will wait for a response indefinitely.
stimulus_duration | numeric | null | How long to display the stimulus in milliseconds. The visibility CSS property of the stimulus will be set to `hidden` after this time has elapsed. If this is null, then the stimulus will remain visible until the trial ends.
margin_vertical | string | '0px' | Vertical margin of the button(s).
margin_horizontal | string | '8px' | Horizontal margin of the button(s).
response_ends_trial | boolean | true | If true, then the trial will end whenever the participant makes a response (assuming they make their response before the cutoff specified by the `trial_duration` parameter). If false, then the trial will continue until the value for `trial_duration` is reached. You can set this parameter to `false` to force the participant to view a stimulus for a fixed amount of time, even if they respond before the time is complete.
enable_button_after | numeric | 0 | How long the button will delay enabling in milliseconds.

## Data Generated

In addition to the [default data collected by all plugins](../overview/plugins.md#data-collected-by-all-plugins), this plugin collects the following data for each trial.

Name | Type | Value
-----|------|------
rt | numeric | The response time in milliseconds for the participant to make a response. The time is measured from when the stimulus first appears on the screen until the participant's response.
response | numeric | Indicates which button the participant pressed. The first button in the `choices` array is 0, the second is 1, and so on.
stimulus | string | The HTML content that was displayed on the screen.
