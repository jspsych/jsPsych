# jspsych-ext-webgazer

This extension supports eye tracking through the [WebGazer](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/) library. For a narrative description of how to use this extension see the [eye tracking overview](../overview/eye-tracking.md).

## Parameters

### Initialization Parameters

Initialization parameters can be set when calling `jsPsych.init()`

```js
jsPsych.init({
  extensions: [
    {type: 'webgazer', params: {...}}
  ]
})
```

Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
----------|------|---------------|------------
webgazer  | object | `undefined` | You can explicitly pass a reference to a loaded instance of the webgazer.js library. If no explicit reference is passed then the extension will look for a global `webgazer` object. If you are loading webgazer.js via a `<script>` tag you do not need to set this parameter in most circumstances.
auto_initialize | bool | false | Whether to automatically initialize webgazer when the experiment begins. If set to `true` then the experiment will attempt to access the user's webcam immediately upon page load. The default value is `false` because it is probably a good idea to explain to the user why camera permission will be needed before asking for it. The `webgazer-init-camera` plugin can be used to initialize the camera during the experiment.
round_predictions | bool | true | Whether to round the `x`,`y` coordinates predicted by WebGazer to the nearest whole number. This *greatly* reduces the size of the data, as WebGazer records data to 15 decimal places by default. Given the noise of the system, there's really no need to record data to this level of precision.
sampling_interval | numeric | 34 | Sets the interval between gaze predictions. Because the underlying code is partially asynchronous, this interval is only approximate. The sampling interval will not be faster than this, on average, but the time between samples may fluctuate. Setting the interval too fast will create performance problems and produce redundant data, as the video feed from most webcams only updates about 30 times per second.

### Trial Parameters

Trial parameters can be set when adding the extension to a trial object.

```js
var trial = {
  type: '...',
  extensions: [
    {type: 'webgazer', params: {...}}
  ]
}
```

Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
----------|------|---------------|------------
targets | array | [] | A list of elements on the page that you would like to record the coordinates of for comparison with the WebGazer data. Each entry in the array should be a valid [CSS selector string](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) that identifies the element. The selector string should be valid for exactly one element on the page. If the selector is valid for more than one element then only the first matching element will be recorded.

## Data Generated

Name | Type | Value
-----|------|------
webgazer_data | array | An array of objects containing gaze data for the trial. Each object has an `x`, a `y`, and a `t` property. The `x` and `y` properties specify the gaze location in pixels and `t` specifies the time in milliseconds since the start of the trial.
webgazer_targets | object | An object contain the pixel coordinates of elements on the screen specified by the `.targets` parameter. Each key in this object will be a `selector` property, containing the CSS selector string used to find the element. The object corresponding to each key will contain `x` and `y` properties specifying the top-left corner of the object, `width` and `height` values, plus `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` parameters which specify the [bounding rectangle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) of the element. 

## Functions

In addition to the jsPsych webgazer-* plugins, the jsPsych webgazer extension provides a set of functions that allow the researcher to interact more directly with WebGazer. These functions can be called at any point during an experiment, and are crucial for building trial plugins that interact with WebGazer. All of the functions below must be prefixed with `jsPsych.extensions.webgazer` (e.g. `jsPsych.extensions.webgazer.faceDetected()`).

### start()

Performs initialization of webgazer, including requesting permissions from the user to access the camera. Returns a `Promise` that resolves when the camera is initialized and fails if the camera cannot be accessed, e.g., because the user denies permission. This is handled automatically if using the `webgazer-init-camera` plugin or setting `auto_initialize` to `true` in the extension parameters.

### isInitialized()

Returns `true` if `start()` has been successfully called at some point, and `false` otherwise.

### faceDetected()

Returns `true` if WebGazer is ready to make predictions (`webgazer.getTracker().predictionReady` is `true`).

### showPredictions()

Turns on WebGazer's real-time visualization of predicted gaze location.

### hidePredictions()

Turns off WebGazer's real-time visualization of predicted gaze location.

### showVideo()

Turns on a display of the webcam image, guiding box for positioning the face, and WebGazer's estimate of the location of facial landmarks.

### hideVideo()

Turns off the camera display.

### resume()

Turns on gaze prediction. The extension will automatically handle this for you in most cases. You probably only need to use this if you are writing your own plugin that interfaces directly with WebGazer.

### pause()

Turns off gaze prediction. The extension will automatically handle this for you in most cases. You probably only need to use this if you are writing your own plugin that interfaces directly with WebGazer.

### resetCalibration()

Clears all calibration data.

### startMouseCalibration()

Turns on mouse movement and mouse clicks as calibration events. While the `webgazer-calibration` plugin can also be used to run a parmeterized calibration routine, this calibration function call allows you to continuously calibrate WebGazer to any mouse movements or clicks throughout the experiment. For example, any *-button-response trial would also function as a WebGazer calibration event. 

### stopMouseCalibration()

Stops WebGazer from using mouse movements and mouse clicks as calibration events.

### calibratePoint(x, y)

Instructs WebGazer to register the location `x`, `y` (in screen pixel coordinates) as a calibration event. Can be used for passive viewing calibration, i.e., instructing participants to fixate at a particular location.

### setRegressionType(regression_type)

Change the method that WebGazer is using to perform feature -> location regression. Valid options are `ridge`, `weightedRidge`, and `threadedRidge`. See the WebGazer docs for more information about these options.
The extension uses the default mode specified by WebGazer (currently `ridge`).

### getCurrentPrediction()

Get the current predicted gaze location from WebGazer. This returns a Promise that resolves once WebGazer has finished computing the gaze prediction. The Promise has a single parameter with an object with `x`, `y`, and, `t` parameters. `t` will be the value of `performance.now()` at approximately the time that the video frame was recorded. 

### startSampleInterval(interval)

Starts sampling gaze predictions every `interval` milliseconds. If `interval` is left undefined then the default value at extension initialization is used. Every sample will trigger an `onGazeUpdate` callback, as well as side effects that result in data storage within the extension.

### stopSampleInterval()

Stops the sampling started by `startSampleInterval()`.

### onGazeUpdate(callback)

Subscribe to gaze updates. The `callback` will be invoked every time a new gaze prediction is generated. The first argument of the `callback` will be an object with `x`, `y`, and, if currently in a trial with the extension turned on, the time `t` in ms since the start of the trial. `t` will be the value of `performance.now()` at approximately the time that the video frame was recorded. If currently in an active trial then `t` will be relative to the start of the trial.

This function returns a close handler. When you no longer need to subscribe to gaze updates, call the close handler. Example:

```js
var cancelGazeUpdateHandler = jsPsych.extensions.webgazer.onGazeUpdate(function(prediction){
  console.log(`Currently looking at ${prediction.x}, ${prediction.y}`);
});

cancelGazeUpdateHandler();
```

You can add multiple handlers. Handlers are not closed automatically, so be sure to cancel them when no longer needed.
