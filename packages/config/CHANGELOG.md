### Patch Changes

- [#3287](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/3287) [`54e04dc9`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/54e04dc93f54a7a019db1fee4961dcc5e02b6fc0) Thanks [@becky-gilbert](https://github.com/becky-gilbert)! - Adds the survey.css file to the dist archive (#3131).

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#3122](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/3122) [`715a9d13`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/715a9d130ec1d4772ce0b61956d8c19be5348fca) Thanks [@bjoluc](https://github.com/bjoluc)! - Upgrade build tools to their latest versions. This doesn't introduce breaking changes to the artifacts built using `@jspsych/config`, but it requires some minor changes to projects using `@jspsych/config`:

  - The minimum required Node.js version is now 18.0.0
  - Jest has been upgraded from v28 to v29 and ts-jest has been replaced with the more performant Sucrase Jest plugin to avoid significant memory leaks. As a consequence, Jest does no longer type-check code. If you are facing any issues, please check Jest's [upgrade guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/upgrading-to-jest29) for instructions on updating your tests.
  - TypeScript has been upgraded from version 4 to version 5. This is very unlikely to break anything in your code though.

### Patch Changes

- [#2631](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/2631) [`e77371e9`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/e77371e94b3496361138d681c16840829f4c5cd2) Thanks [@bjoluc](https://github.com/bjoluc)! - Update dependencies, including Jest v27 to v28.
