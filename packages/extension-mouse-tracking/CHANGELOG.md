## 1.0.0
### Major Changes



- [#2228](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/2228) [`3e2e3ac8`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/3e2e3ac86782c8c551b92cc087221994197adfe4) Thanks [@jodeleeuw](https://github.com/jodeleeuw)! - Created an extension that enables mouse tracking. The extension records the coordinates and time of mousemove, mousedown, and mouseup events, as well as optionally recording the coordinates of objects on the screen to enable mapping of mouse events onto screen objects.
