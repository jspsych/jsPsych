jsPsych is a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser.

## Extension Description

The webgazer extension supports eye tracking through the [Webgazer](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/) library. For examples of how to use this extension, see the [eyetracking overview](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/overview/eye-tracking/).

## Examples

Several example experiments and plugin demonstrations are available in the `/examples` folder.
After you've downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases), double-click on an example HTML file to run it in your web browser, and open it with a programming-friendly text editor to see how it works.
