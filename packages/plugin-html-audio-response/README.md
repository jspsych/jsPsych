jsPsych is a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser.

## Plugin Description

The html-audio-response plugin displays HTML content and records audio from the participant via a microphone. In order to get access to the microphone, use the [initialize-microphone plugin](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/plugins/initialize-microphone/) before this plugin.

The audio data is recorded in base 64 format, which is a text representation of the audio that may be converted into others. Note that this plugin will _quickly_ generate large amounts of data, so if a large amount of audio needs to be recorded, consider storing the data on a server immediately and deleting it from the data object (This is shown in the documentation link below).

In addition to the default base64 saving, this plugin now supports:
- **Server upload** via the `save_via_api` parameter, which uploads the audio file to a specified API endpoint. A loading spinner and customizable `upload_wait_message` are shown during upload.
- **Local file saving** via the `save_locally` parameter, which saves the audio file directly to the participant's default Downloads folder with a random UUID filename.

These options can be used individually or together, and if neither is enabled, the original base64 behavior is preserved.

## Examples

Several example experiments and plugin demonstrations are available in the `/examples` folder.
After you've downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases), double-click on an example HTML file to run it in your web browser, and open it with a programming-friendly text editor to see how it works.
