jsPsych is a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser.

## Plugin Description

The cloze plugin displays a text with certain words omitted. Participants are asked to replace the missing words, and are recorded upon clicking a button. Responses can be evaluated and a function is called in case of either differences or incomplete answers, making it possible to inform participants about mistakes before proceeding.

## Examples

Several example experiments and plugin demonstrations are available in the `/examples` folder.
After you've downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases), double-click on an example HTML file to run it in your web browser, and open it with a programming-friendly text editor to see how it works.
