jsPsych is a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser.

## Plugin Description

The image-keyboard-response plugin displays an image and records responses generated by the keyboard. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the participant does not respond within a fixed length of time.

## Examples

Several example experiments and plugin demonstrations are available in the `/examples` folder.
After you've downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases), double-click on an example HTML file to run it in your web browser, and open it with a programming-friendly text editor to see how it works.
