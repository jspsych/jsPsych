## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3385](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/3385) [`3948fdc0ac176584fe4b8fe0b9cca5ed6e8b3afc`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/3948fdc0ac176584fe4b8fe0b9cca5ed6e8b3afc) Thanks [@cherriechang](https://github.com/cherriechang)! - Added citations property to info field of all plugins/extensions in two citation formats (apa, bibtex); added getCitations() as function in jsPsych package allowing user to generate citations by passing an array of plugins/extensions by name as first input and citation format as string as second input; changed template of plugins/extensions to contain citations field by default; citations for each plugin/extension are automatically generated from .cff file (if any) at its folder's root during build process; getCitations() prints out citations in the form of a string separating each citation with newline character, and always prints the jsPsych library citation first.

### Patch Changes

- [#2359](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/2359) [`a8ab2eb8`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/a8ab2eb8f8be7c22261960e460d9b6bf79e48465) Thanks [@jodeleeuw](https://github.com/jodeleeuw)! - Fixes the `response_allowed_while_playing` parameter to use the `stop` time of the video as the event that enables a response.

* [#2359](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/2359) [`d8b23ca3`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/d8b23ca36539501c552f180a213192e13fc18cc9) Thanks [@jodeleeuw](https://github.com/jodeleeuw)! - When `require_movement` is `true`, allow changes to the slider using the keyboard to enable the button (#1783).

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#2183](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/2183) [`c8760b1`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/c8760b19483453b0e77dc98e464e1629b5605a15) Thanks [@jodeleeuw](https://github.com/jodeleeuw), [@becky-gilbert](https://github.com/becky-gilbert), [@bjoluc](https://github.com/bjoluc)! - **jsPsych is now fully modular, with individual NPM packages for the core library, plugins, and extensions.**

  To support this change, we've made a number of breaking changes. We've added [a guide for migrating from version 6.x to 7.x](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/support/migration-v7/) to the documentation, and updated the [hello world tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/tutorials/hello-world/) with instructions for configuring jsPsych in three different ways. In addition to enabling package management, some of the benefits that this change provides include an improved developer experience with IntelliSense code hints, proper encapsulation of jsPsych so that multiple instances can be run on the same page, and easier integration with modern JavaScript tools like bundlers.

### Minor Changes

- [#2143](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/2143) [`7fa8f26`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/7fa8f2632538bba1a89444a43a5704ec94982aed) Thanks [@jodeleeuw](https://github.com/jodeleeuw)! - When `require_movement` is true a 'touchstart' event or a 'mousedown' event will now enable the button. This means that this parameter will work on mobile devices, and that the button will become enabled as soon as the paricipant interacts with the slider rather than after they click and release the slider.

* [#2129](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/2129) [`f37f64a`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/f37f64ac61ca4d934bf19a4dd15c9370ac4c2a8e) Thanks [@jodeleeuw](https://github.com/jodeleeuw)! - All duration measurements, including response times, are now rounded to the nearest millisecond. We changed this because the precision that `performance.now()` generates is misleading in this context and removing the (often very long) decimal component of the measurement will save space in the data files.

### Patch Changes

- [#1533](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/1533) [`7b16a1d`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/7b16a1d) Thanks [@becky-gilbert](https://github.com/becky-gilbert)! - Fixed a bug that caused the trial to not end when the `trial_ends_after_video` parameter was set to `true` and the video ended at a specific time via the `stop` parameter.

* [#2192](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/2192) [`2883e421`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/2883e4211dbf8c6bb5cf291289ff2e3f82252032) Thanks [@becky-gilbert](https://github.com/becky-gilbert)! - Fix implementation of `start` parameter in `video-*` plugins so that it works in iOS/MacOS browsers.

* Updated dependencies [[`37b85f95`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/37b85f953c803e1cca80d8e5275be948d375e2f2), [`37b85f95`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/37b85f953c803e1cca80d8e5275be948d375e2f2), [`37b85f95`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/37b85f953c803e1cca80d8e5275be948d375e2f2), [`37b85f95`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/37b85f953c803e1cca80d8e5275be948d375e2f2), [`37b85f95`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/37b85f953c803e1cca80d8e5275be948d375e2f2), [`37b85f95`](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/commit/37b85f953c803e1cca80d8e5275be948d375e2f2)]:
