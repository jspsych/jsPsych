jsPsych is a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser.

## Plugin Description

The preload plugin loads images, audio, and video files into the browser's memory before they are needed in the experiment, in order to improve stimulus and response timing, and to avoid disrupting the flow of the experiment. It's recommended to use this plugin anytime you need to load media files, especially if the experiment needs a large and/or diverse set of media files.

## Examples

Several example experiments and plugin demonstrations are available in the `/examples` folder.
After you've downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases), double-click on an example HTML file to run it in your web browser, and open it with a programming-friendly text editor to see how it works.
